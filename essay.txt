Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me. Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer. Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late! Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die.  The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me. Yes, Artoo. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir. Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. No problem. Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by. Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. So what I have told you was true. from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.  Anakin was a good friend. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!  Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost. You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All. Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.  Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.  Master Yoda. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. I got an idea. Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me. It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine! All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. All right. Stand by. Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.  Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota.
